## Generate Fake Data

  - add the logic to your `seeds.rb` file for creating the book models

## Deliverables

- push changes to Github to the branch, `part-01-initial-app`

  ```
  $ git checkout part-01-initial-app
  $ git push
  ```

- merge changes into the master branch and push to Github

  ```
  $ git checkout master
  $ git merge part-01-initial-app
  $ git push
  ```

- send me the link to your `part-01-initial-app` branch
